# M01W03 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager yarn pnpm
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?
- [x] Practice unit testing

### Assertion
* a forceful statement of fact or belief
* if it doesn't do what it's supposed to, I want an error

C => executable => run the executable

### What is Node?
* JS translator
* wrapped in C++
* Google created Node
* V8 engine
* added optional modules

### CommonJS
* we export code with module.exports
* we require code with require

### Test Runner
* runs that your tests automatically
* blazingly fast


```
npm install package-name # saves it as a dependency
npm install package-name --save-dev # saves as development dependency
npm install package-name --global # every app on your machine can see this code
```

### Unit Testing
* testing the smallest part of your code (functions)

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* write the tests before you write the code
* mock exam
